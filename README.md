README

This repository includes two different types of feature sets used to train and test the machine learning algorithms in the paper titled "Mobile Malware Detection by Analyzing Official Market Metadata". As described in Section 5.1 of the paper, 2 datasets used in the analyses were the permission dataset and the extended dataset. First type of feature set for both datasets includes the initially considered features, i.e. case of no feature selection. Second type of feature set is the reduced set including the features selected for further analysis as described in Section 5.2.
